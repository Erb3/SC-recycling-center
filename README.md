A recycling center on the SwitchCraft minecraft server.

Originally made by PC_Cat, now maintained by the public.

**The code is currently quite bad, and we know it. It had to be made ASAP, so feel free to improve with PRs.**

## Requirements:

* Everything must run on one turtle
* No startup chaining
* No profiting
